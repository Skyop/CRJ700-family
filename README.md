# Bombardier CRJ700 series

This is a project to develop the Bombardier CRJ700/900/1000 regional jet for [FlightGear Flight Simulator](http://www.flightgear.org/).

It is already a highly complete and functional aircraft, with a realistic model, cockpit, and autopilot. 
Contributions and pull requests, of course, are welcome.
